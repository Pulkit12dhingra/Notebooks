# KMeans
Application of KMeans clustering algorithm

It will help if you think of items as points in an n-dimensional space).  The algorithm will categorize the items into k groups of similarity. To calculate that similarity, we will use the euclidean distance as measurement.

The algorithm works as follows:

First we initialize k points, called means, randomly.
We categorize each item to its closest mean and we update the meanâ€™s coordinates, which are the averages of the items categorized in that mean so far.
We repeat the process for a given number of iterations and at the end, we have our clusters.
