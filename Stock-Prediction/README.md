# Stock-Prediction-
Using RNN to predict the stock
RNN are used to predict one step forcast on the stock pricing dataset. The data that I used is available at the link:-https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pU6qCnlxy6BlJW95tOcAV9_hOzyq7nKm?usp=sharing

LSTM is used but we may also use GRU and Simple RNN for similar results.
