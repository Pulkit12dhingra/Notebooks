# CNN
 
Convolutional Neural Network or CNN In deep learning, a convolutional neural network (CNN, or ConvNet) is a class of deep neural networks, most commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery. They are also known as shift invariant or space invariant artificial neural networks (SIANN), based on their shared-weights architecture and translation invariance characteristics. They have applications in image and video recognition, recommender systems, image classification, medical image analysis, natural language processing, and financial time series.

It uses different layers for it's implimentation some of which are stated below:-
1. Convolution Layer
2. Pooling layer

CNN itself is a big field to read about so these links may help you as they helped me:-

# Tensorflow

TensorFlow. is a free and open-source software library for dataflow and differentiable programming across a range of tasks. It is a symbolic math library, and is also used for machine learning applications such as neural networks. It is used for both research and production at Google.

For documentation you may visit:-https://www.tensorflow.org/

Deep Learning is really a demanding field in recent time. ANN is the basic of Deep learning this project is to give a basic idea of deep learning using tensorflow.

I learned a lot while making this project and I hope you will gain something from it too.

## Enjoyyy.......!! :)
