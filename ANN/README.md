# ANN
Artificial Neural Network Implimentation


## What is Artificial neural network??

Well,An artificial neural network (ANN) is the piece of a computing system designed to simulate the way the human brain analyzes and processes information. It is the foundation of artificial intelligence (AI) and solves problems that would prove impossible or difficult by human or statistical standards. ANNs have self-learning capabilities that enable them to produce better results as more data becomes available.

## Regression 

Regression basically in layman terms predicting the future while looking at the past. It is a method of finding out relationship between a dependent and an indipendent variable.

## Classification 

Classification is a type of supervised learning. It specifies the class to which data elements belong to and is best used when the output has finite and discrete values. It predicts a class for an input variable as well.

## Tensorflow 

TensorFlow. is a free and open-source software library for dataflow and differentiable programming across a range of tasks. It is a symbolic math library, and is also used for machine learning applications such as neural networks. It is used for both research and production at Google.

Deep Learning is really a demanding field in recent time. ANN is the basic of Deep learning this project is to give a basic idea of deep learning using tensorflow.

I learned a lot while making this project and I hope you will gain something from it too.

# Enjoyyy.......!! :)
